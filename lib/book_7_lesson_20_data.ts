    title: "Reading Passage: Saving the Planet",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `Smog is a mixture of smoke and fog. Americans became unhappily aware of it in the 1960s when it hung over Los Angeles for days on end. Smog made the air not only unpleasant to breathe but actually **detrimental** to people's health. Many believed this polluted air, produced by smoke from vehicle exhausts and factory chimneys, to be an **omen** of things to come if people did not take better care of the environment.

The environment is the world we inhabit—everything living and **inanimate**. Environmentalists are people who wish to preserve the environment; they **deplore** the damage we are doing to it and remind us that we share our planet with millions of other **species** of plants and animals. They cherish this **diversity** of life and believe we all should do the same.

For a long time, governments, at both the state and national level, had been **derelict** when it came to protecting the environment. The chief reason for this was the **apathy** of the public. The public was largely unaware of environmental damage until it was almost too late. Rachel Carson's *Silent Spring*, published in 1962, warned of the harm being done to the environment by overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Her book had an enormous impact. Voters began to take an interest in environmental issues. That gave lawmakers the **incentive** to take action. Environmentalists **badgered** Congress to pass laws such as the Clean Air Acts of 1970 and 1990. Finally, industries that were the worst polluters were **compelled** to reduce the **emissions** from vehicles and factory chimneys.

Citizens cannot, however, be **deluded** into thinking that simply passing laws will protect people from environmental harm. Individuals must remain active. An example of a person who did just this is Janice Dickerson. She made it her mission in life to educate people about the dangers of living along a seventy-five-mile stretch of the Mississippi River south of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. During recent decades, the area witnessed the building of more than one hundred chemical factories and oil refineries. Those factories emitted smoke from chimneys and dumped chemicals into the river. Known as "cancer alley," this area has one of the highest cancer rates in the United States.

One evening in March 2015, LeeAnne Walters, of Flint, Michigan, decided she had had enough. Her family had been suffering from numerous medical problems for months. Her twin sons kept breaking out in rashes, and one had stopped growing normally. Others in her family had been rushed to the hospital with stomach problems. But that March evening was when LeeAnne decided to act. That was when her eldest daughter showed her a clump of hair that had fallen out while she was taking a shower.

LeeAnne Walters suspected that something in the drinking water might be the cause. She sent a sample to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), where it was tested and found to contain high levels of lead, one of the most **toxic** substances known. LeeAnne, working closely with the EPA, discovered the cause. To save money, the city had switched its drinking supply water from Lake Huron to the Flint River, a former dumping ground for manufacturers. Other nearby towns tested their water and found that the problem was more widespread than Flint. The cost to replace water pipes will run into billions of dollars.

One of the most effective ways of getting people involved in environmental issues has been Earth Day. The purpose of Earth Day is to **foster** awareness of the harm we are doing to our planet. Started in 1970 in the United States, it has grown rapidly, and on Earth Day in 2009, more than a billion people around the world participated in its activities. Earth Day is celebrated each year on April 22, but to those who care about the environment, every day is Earth Day.`,

    content: `• The Greek word *pathos* means "suffering" or "feeling" and has passed unchanged into English; *pathos* in English means "something that moves a person to feel pity." The Greek prefix *ab-* (sometimes written *a-*) means "not" or "without" and combines with *pathos* to form the word **apathy**. A person who cannot feel for others or who doesn't care about them is in a state of *apathy*. We say that such a person is *apathetic*.

• The Greek prefix *syn-* (sometimes written *sym-*) means "with" or "together." It combines with *pathos* to form the noun *sympathy*, "an emotional feeling for other people and a sharing of their sorrow." The adjective form is *sympathetic*. If you have a serious problem, you need to talk to someone who is *sympathetic*. Someone who is *apathetic* would not be interested in your problem.

• Don't confuse **emit**, which means "to give off," with *omit*, which means "to leave out."

• **Species** is both a singular noun (a *species*) and a plural noun (many *species*). A **species** is one of the major groups into which all living things—plants and animals—are divided. Although the production of offspring normally takes place only within the same *species*, creatures of different, though related, *species* can produce offspring. An example of this is the mule; it is the result of mating a male donkey with a female horse.

• *Specie* (a less common word, spelled without the final *s*) means "money in the form of coin." Dollar bills are paper money. Nickels, dimes, and quarters are money in the form of *specie*.`,
