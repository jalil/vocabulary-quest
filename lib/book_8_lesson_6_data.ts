    content: `After Captain Bligh and the eighteen members of his crew who remained loyal to him were set adrift in an open boat, they understood clearly that the chance of their surviving to report the **calamity** was slim. Nevertheless, Bligh wasted no time in raising the sail and ordering the men to start rowing. He also began a journal, in which he **meticulously** recorded everything that happened.

The greatest hazard they faced was the weather. In stormy seas the overcrowded twenty-three-foot boat was tossed so mercilessly that drowning seemed **imminent**. One storm, which lasted two weeks, kept the men thoroughly soaked the entire time. On other days, the **sweltering** heat of the tropical sun left them too exhausted to row. They stayed alive by collecting rainwater and by stopping at tiny, uninhabited islands to gather fruit and oysters. In this way they added to the meager supply of food and water they had been given when they were set adrift.

At last, weak and barely alive, they reached Timor, north of Australia, where they were received by the Dutch governor of the island. Their ordeal had lasted forty-one days. Another ten weeks **elapsed** before Captain Bligh was well enough to leave for England. When he arrived there in March 1790, he was **lionized** by the public for his amazing feat of crossing almost four thousand miles of uncharted ocean in an open boat. Nevertheless, losing one's ship as the result of a mutiny was a serious matter that required investigation. Bligh defended his actions well before the court of inquiry, which was conducted by the navy. They ruled that he was not responsible for the loss of his ship.

The British government took a quite different view of the mutineers, however. Having learned that some of the former crew members of the *Bounty* were on Tahiti, the navy sent an armed ship, the *Pandora*, to bring them to justice. When the ship arrived in March 1791, the officers found that many of the mutineers had married Tahitian women and were beginning to **assimilate** into the life of the island. All the men were quickly **apprehended** and taken aboard the *Pandora*, where they were **interrogated** by the captain. They told him that Fletcher Christian, with eight crew members, had sailed away to an unknown destination after a brief stay on Tahiti.

With the captured mutineers on board, the *Pandora* set sail for England. On the return voyage, however, four of the prisoners drowned when the ship sank in a storm. They had been kept **shackled** below decks, with the captain refusing to release them until the last moment before the ship went down. Of those remaining, six were **arraigned** when they eventually reached England. At the trial that followed, three were found guilty and hanged for **conspiring** to take over the *Bounty* by force. The others were set free.

And yet the story does not end there. In 1808, an American seal-hunting ship called the *Topaz* dropped anchor off what was believed to be an uninhabited island thirteen hundred miles southeast of Tahiti. A party sent ashore to explore discovered a man there named Alexander Smith. He had been one of the mutineers on the *Bounty*, and he had a **bizarre** tale to tell the American sailors.

Twenty years before, he said, Fletcher Christian had sailed to this speck of land, known today as Pitcairn Island, accompanied by eight of his fellow mutineers and eighteen Tahitians. After the *Bounty* had burned and sunk, the men and women began their new life on the island. But **dissension** soon developed when the sailors tried to force the Tahitians to become their servants. Quarrels led to violence and eventually to murder. The society they had established collapsed into **anarchy**. Within ten years of the *Bounty*'s arrival at the island, Alexander Smith was the only one of the men left alive. Today, his descendants still live on Pitcairn Island.`,
