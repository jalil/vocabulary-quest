    title: "Reading Passage: The Kachina Dolls of Oraibi",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `The village of Oraibi lies in the middle of the four-thousand-square-mile Hopi Reservation in the northeast corner of Arizona. It is believed to be the oldest continuously inhabited village in North America. Oraibi was first settled nearly a thousand years ago by the Anasazi, a **pastoral** people, who excelled in the creation of beautiful objects.

The descendants of the Anasazi, the Hopi people, now inhabit the area and continue the tradition of making fine pottery, woven rugs, and baskets. But Hopi artistry is best **exemplified** by the unique form of carved wooden figures known as kachinas. These figures are sculpted from the root of the cottonwood tree and range in size from a few inches up to two feet. The heads often have **ornately** carved masks. The finished figures are painted in bright colors and **embellished** with shells, feathers, and semiprecious stones.

The kachina carvings are representations of the Hopi spirit world. In the Hopi view, everything in the world is inhabited by a spirit; when people succeed in living in harmony and balance with the spirits, the world will be at peace. The carvings represent the spirits of **hallowed** figures from Hopi history as well as of plants and animals, the sun, the moon, and the stars.

From late December to late July, the spirits are believed to be on Earth. During this time, the Hopi perform ceremonies in their villages. Masked and costumed dancers **impersonate** the spirits in celebrations held in their honor. Some of the dancers represent **benign**, gift-bearing kachinas who present children with carved dolls. These are not toys, for they have a religious and social significance. But neither are they worshiped as idols. They are hung on the walls of Hopi homes, and by learning what each kachina doll stands for, the children **discern** the history, codes of behavior, and religion of their people. Along with the gift-bearing kachinas, there are also representations of **malevolent** spirits who dance through the village streets. Supposedly, they are searching for those in the community who have been disobedient. These demon kachinas are often **grotesque** in appearance, frightening to those who see them approaching.

Until the late nineteenth century, outside visitors were rare in Hopi villages; their inhabitants did not encourage such visits, and the paths leading to the high, flat hilltops were very **precarious**. But once roads were built, access to the heights was easy; soon, tourists began to outnumber the residents. They came to watch the religious ceremonies held in the spring and summer. As mementos, they purchased kachina dolls. Hopi carvers, who once had made these dolls only for use in their own communities, stepped up production to meet the demand.

Gradually, the kachinas began to change. Tourists wanted larger carvings and figures showing action. The size of a kachina was **augmented** by the addition of other carved pieces attached by glue; and because many Hopi were opposed to the sale of their religious objects to outsiders, the figures were **executed** so that they differed from those used in Hopi ceremonies.

Today, many Hopi carvers continue the ancient tradition, using the same simple materials and tools of earlier generations. Collectors of Native American art purchase kachina dolls directly from these carvers or from gift shops that feature their work. Some carvers have achieved world **renown**; their work commands prices in the thousands of dollars.

**Connoisseurs** of Hopi carving who travel to Oklahoma City will find over sixty kachina dolls on permanent display at the National Cowboy Hall of Fame. In Phoenix, Arizona, the place to visit is the Heard Museum. It is famous for its collection of over four hundred dolls, many of them presented to the museum by Arizona's then-senator Barry Goldwater.`,

*   The Latin *bene* means "good" or "well" and forms the root of **benign**, "good-natured" or "kindly." It is found in *benediction*, "a blessing"; *benefactor*, "one who does good works"; *beneficial*, "producing good results"; and *benevolent*, "having a desire to do good."

*   The Latin *male* means "bad" or "ill" and forms the root of **malevolent**. It is found in *malady*, "an illness"; *malcontent*, "one who is unsatisfied"; *malediction*, "a curse"; and *malfunction*, "failure to work properly."

*   Many people think that **grotesque** is a fancy word for "ugly" or "disgusting." It isn't. Something is *grotesque* when it is distorted or bizarre. Gargoyles are grotesque; so are the imaginative creatures in Maurice Sendak's *Where the Wild Things Are*.
