    title: "Reading Passage: The Triangle Fire",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `A hundred years ago, American industry was growing fast and needed workers badly. It found them in the millions of immigrants who poured into the United States from Europe. Most passed through Ellis Island in New York Harbor with little money and few possessions. Many went no farther than New York City in their search for jobs. Young women found employment in the overcrowded, unsanitary, and unsafe factories of the city's garment district. In these sweatshops they worked long hours for low wages. Fire inspections were **lax**, and fire equipment was inadequate. It was **inevitable** that tragedy would strike sooner or later.

On Saturday, March 25, 1911, the top three floors of a ten-story building on New York's Lower East Side were crowded with women working for the Triangle Shirtwaist Company. Late in the afternoon, a bin containing waste fabric on the eighth floor began to **smolder**. No one noticed until it suddenly burst into flames. Women in the crowded workroom tried frantically to put out the rapidly spreading fire, but their efforts were in vain. **Acrid** smoke filled the room. Many of the women, coughing, choking, and unable to see where they were going, were trampled in the **headlong** rush for the only unlocked door in the workroom. The owners of the company always kept the other doors locked to prevent women from slipping outside into the hallway for a break when they were supposed to be working.

Those who fled into the heavily **congested** hallway found that just one elevator was working. Only twelve women were able to use it. The fire escape collapsed under the weight of people crowding onto it. The narrow stairway, less than three feet wide, **impeded** the movement of the women, leaving many trapped. More than forty women jumped from windows and **hurtled** to their deaths eighty-five feet below. Others flung themselves down the elevator shaft in desperate attempts to escape. Firefighters at the scene were unable to **cope** with the situation. Water from their hoses failed to reach the flames because the pressure was too low; their ladders reached only to the sixth floor.

A **throng** estimated at over a hundred thousand people attended the mass funeral of the victims of the fire. Incredible as it sounds, an official inquiry later found that the Triangle Shirtwaist Company had not been guilty of **negligence**. **Irate** citizens demanded that such a tragedy never be allowed to happen again. As a result of the fire, new safety measures were **initiated**. Laws dealing with building safety were made more **stringent**, and firefighting equipment and methods were improved. But the changes came too late for the unfortunate 145 women who were **casualties** of New York's Triangle fire.`,

    content: `* **Initiate** and *begin* are synonyms, but their meanings carry a difference that should be noted. *Begin* is the general, all-purpose word for the start of something; one can *begin* anything, from a sentence to a world war! **Initiate** has a narrower meaning; it suggests taking the first in a series of major steps. (A president may **initiate** a new policy; a teacher may **initiate** new attendance rules.) *Initiative* is the first step in bringing something about. (I took the *initiative* by demanding a change.) *Initiative* is also the ability to get things done without waiting to be told. (You must show *initiative* if you wish to be given the part in the play.)

* **Negligent** means "failing to give proper attention to" and is formed from the verb *neglect*.
