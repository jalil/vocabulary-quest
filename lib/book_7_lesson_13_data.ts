    content: `In 1917, Amelia Earhart was working as a nurse's helper in Canada, caring for pilots wounded in the First World War. Their stories **kindled** an interest in flying in the nineteen-year-old girl, so after the war she took lessons and became a **proficient** pilot. As soon as she had saved enough money, she bought her own plane. She soon broke the women's altitude record, taking her tiny biplane up to fourteen thousand feet. By that time, flying had become an **obsession**. Earhart's **zest** for adventure led her to become the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic. She also became the first person to make the perilous solo flight from Hawaii to California. Previous attempts had claimed the lives of ten pilots.

In 1931, she married publisher George Putnam. A **canny** businessperson, Putnam acted as his wife's manager and was her **mentor** in the ways of business. In addition to being world famous for her exploits in the air, Earhart was **personable** and enjoyed being in the spotlight. This made it easy for Putnam to promote her activities. He published the books she wrote. He got her contracts with advertisers to **endorse** products. He also set up **lucrative** speaking tours in which Earhart talked not only about flying but also about other issues important to her, such as women's rights and world peace. The money they earned in these ways was used to help meet the high costs of buying and maintaining Earhart's aircraft.

On June 1, 1937, at the age of thirty-nine, Earhart took off in a twin-engine Lockheed Electra on a round-the-world flight. Accomplishing this long-term goal was to be the **climax** of her career. The event, which began by heading east from California, attracted worldwide interest. **Exuberant** crowds greeted her at every stop of the flight, eager to catch a glimpse of the **intrepid** flier. On the morning of July 2, she took off on the most **arduous** leg of the journey, a 2,500-mile flight from New Guinea to tiny Howland Island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Twenty hours into the flight, having covered most of the journey, Earhart radioed that she was running out of fuel. She never made it to Howland Island. Massive air and sea rescue missions produced no clues as to her fate.

Amelia Earhart's disappearance remained a complete mystery for over fifty years. Then, in 1992, searchers found part of a shoe that may have belonged to Earhart, together with some scraps of aluminum, possibly from her plane, on Nikumaroro Island, five hundred miles south of Howland Island. The plane could have crash-landed there when it ran out of fuel. If this is indeed what happened, Earhart and her navigator would have been in desperate **straits**. They could not have survived more than a few days. Temperatures on the island reach 120 degrees. They would have had only a **scanty** supply of water on board, and there was none on the island. Their bodies, and the remains of the plane, would have been swept out to sea in a relatively short time. Is this what actually happened to Amelia Earhart? It is a likely explanation, but we will probably never know for sure. Still, the search continues. In 2015, it was revealed that a piece of aluminum sheeting, measuring nineteen inches by twenty-three inches, found on Nikumaroro Island, almost certainly came from Earhart's plane. Note the word "almost." Nothing has yet been proven.`,

    content: `• The adjective formed from the word **climax** is *climactic*. (The *climactic* scene in a movie is the one toward which the earlier scenes have been leading.) Don't confuse this word with *climatic*, which is the adjective form of *climate*. (The great ice ages were the result of *climatic* changes.)

• The Latin *dorsum* means "back" and occurs in several English words. The *dorsal* fin of a fish is the one growing from its back; the familiar triangular fin of a shark is perhaps the best-known example. Our vocabulary word **endorse** comes from this same Latin root. When you *endorse* a check or other document, you sign your name on the back of it.

• A **mentor** is a wise friend and counselor, one who takes responsibility for another person's education and instructs her or him in the ways of business or a profession. The word comes from Homer's great epic poem *The Odyssey*. While its main character Odysseus was engaged in his adventurous travels, his friend Mentor was entrusted with the running of his household and with the education of his son Telemachus.`,
