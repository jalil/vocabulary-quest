    title: "Triumph of the Rail",
    content: "In the early afternoon of May 10th, 1869, in Promontory Summit, Utah, Leland Stanford reared back and swung a sledgehammer down toward the head of a golden spike. With the final blow, the vast expanse of the North American continent was finally connected by ribbons of steel track, ushering in a new age for the United States and the world.\n\nThe Transcontinental Railroad was a monumental undertaking requiring the most modern engineering knowhow and gruelling manual labor to complete. By 1869, after seven years and nearly 2,000 miles of track laid, the two coasts of North America were connected, helping transform a fragmented nation into an industrial powerhouse. The road to a transcontinental railroad included nearly insurmountable obstacles, and the project only succeeded with the dogged determination of many individuals, both famous and unsung.\n\nThe idea for a Transcontinental Railroad dated back to the 1840s when railroad barons first envisioned a complete transportation network to move people, goods, and raw materials from coast to coast. Much of the early planning centered on two contentious issues; where would be the route, and how would the project be funded. Planners considered three possible routes, one northern, one central, and one southern. Each route posed challenges. The northern route was highly susceptible to snow, the central route required traversing the formidable Sierra Nevada mountains, and the southern route crossed through territory yet to be incorporated into the United States. Eventually, the central route was selected as the most direct route, despite the mountains of granite standing in the way. For financing, the railroad tycoons Leland Stanford (Central Pacific Railroad) and Thomas C. Durant (Union Pacific Railroad) forged a private-public partnership with the federal government resulting in payments to the companies of $16,000 per mile of level track, $32,000 per mile for hilly terrain, and $48,000 per mile in the mountains.\n\nWith the plan in place, the real work began. The Central Pacific launched from Sacramento, California and worked eastward, while the Union Pacific set out from Council Bluffs, Iowa and moved toward the west. The work was labor-intensive and dangerous. Laborers relied on shovels, hammers, and other basic tools to construct mile after mile through treacherous terrain and in extreme weather conditions. The hard granite of the Sierra Nevadas required the use of crude and volatile explosives. When the more stable and commonly used black powder explosive proved insufficient for the job, the railroad companies turned to the still experimental and highly unstable explosive nitroglycerin. Fatal accidents followed. To house workers and supplies, the companies constructed rudimentary towns along the route that earned the nickname “Hell on Wheels.” The building of the railroad fell to the most readily available source of cheap labor, immigrant populations. Irish immigrants comprised much of the Union Pacific’s workforce, while the Central Pacific recruited thousands of laborers from the Guangdong region of China. These workers represented the first major influx of Asians to the United States and their essential contribution to the project’s success was long ignored.\n\nOn June 1, 1876, the Transcontinental Express departed New York City and arrived in San Francisco four days later, making it the first train to travel from coast to coast. Prior to the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad, this journey would have taken months to complete, now it was a mere 83-hour gallop across the continent.",
