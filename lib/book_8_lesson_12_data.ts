    title: "Reading Passage: Hearst Castle's Master Builder",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `As part of the tour of Hearst Castle, also known as San Simeon, in southern California, visitors get to see home movies. These films show many of the celebrities who were guests there during the 1930s and 1940s. In one film, a tiny, bespectacled woman hiding her face behind a sheaf of papers is mistakenly identified by the narrator as William Randolph Hearst's secretary. In fact, she was Julia Morgan, the architect who designed and supervised the building of the castle, which some have described as the most **ostentatious** residence of the twentieth century.

There is an explanation for the error. Julia Morgan, despite being an extremely **prolific** architect, with over seven hundred buildings to her credit, was a very **reticent** person; she actively avoided publicity for herself. From early in her career, she rarely gave interviews. When she retired at the age of seventy-nine, she had all her architectural drawings destroyed. She declared that the buildings themselves would be her **legacy**. As a result, very little was written about her for many years.

Julia Morgan was born into an **affluent** San Francisco family in 1872. At that time, it was not common for young women to attend college. Despite this fact, Morgan entered the engineering school at the University of California at Berkeley. After graduation, she became the first woman admitted as an architectural student to the **prestigious** École des Beaux Arts in Paris, France. When her studies were completed, she returned to California, ready to open her own firm. First, however, she had to pass the state licensing exam. In 1904, she became the first woman to receive an architectural license to practice in that state.

Morgan had great skill in understanding her clients' wishes and in carrying them out successfully. She designed and built private homes as well as public buildings. One of her clients was Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, a wealthy widow and **philanthropist**. Her only child was the publishing **tycoon** William Randolph Hearst. When Mrs. Hearst died in 1919, her son inherited her enormous fortune. To match his great wealth, Hearst had extravagant plans: He would have a huge home built on his 275,000-acre ranch, midway between San Francisco and Los Angeles. For this project, he hired Julia Morgan.

Hearst was a collector of art and antiques on a massive scale. He told Morgan he wanted his home to be a museum for his collection, which included Greek vases, oriental rugs, tapestries, paintings, suits of armor, and even entire ceilings stripped from European castles. He would send her photographs of items he had bought or was thinking of buying and instruct her to "build something around this."

Morgan not only designed the main house and three separate guesthouses; she also **immersed** herself in every detail of the project, including the gardens, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and a private zoo. She designed tiles, light fixtures, and stained glass windows; she even selected the color of the thread for the bedspreads. Because she was a perfectionist, she often had workmen **dismantle** what they had done so it could be rebuilt to satisfy her exacting requirements.

One of the most **irksome** problems Morgan faced was Hearst's fickleness. He often bought new items and expected them to be incorporated into the design, regardless of whether a room was already finished. In addition, his taste was erratic; he often changed his mind. A fireplace would be moved to a different wall; a swimming pool would be redesigned because he decided to make it larger. We can assume that Morgan made her views known, but in the end she **acceded** to her client's fanciful wishes.

The result of these labors, which continued almost without a break from 1919 until 1947, hangs in a precarious balance between magnificent and gaudy, a **panorama** of architecture and landscaping that is overwhelming in its size and display. In the main house alone, there are 38 bedrooms, 41 bathrooms, 14 sitting rooms, 2 libraries, a kitchen, and a movie theater.

To create this fantasy took the skills of hundreds of **artisans** — carpenters, plumbers, electricians, stone masons and casts of concrete, plasterers, and woodcarvers. In every sense, Julia Morgan is the creator of San Simeon. But the relationship was not **arbitrary**; without the Hearst fortune, this unique monument to extravagance would never have been built.`,

*   The Latin *fluere*, "to flow," forms the root of **affluent**. Someone who is *affluent* is one to whom wealth flows freely. Other words formed from this root include *fluid*, *fluent* (speech that flows), *influence* (a flow of power to affect others), and *influenza* (which was once thought to be an evil influence flowing from the stars).

*   You might think that **artisan** is related to *art*, but the connection is only indirect. An *artisan* is a skilled craftsperson who makes things, such as furniture or jewelry, while an *artist* is a person who creates works of art, such as paintings or poems. Both words come from the Latin *ars*, "skill."

*   Someone who is **meticulous** is extremely careful about details. Someone who is **fastidious** is difficult to please. Someone who is **irksome** is annoying or tedious.

*   A **panorama** is a complete view of a surrounding area. The word comes from two Greek words: *pan*, meaning "all," and *horama*, meaning "sight." A *panorama* permits one to see everything.
