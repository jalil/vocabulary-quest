    content: `This folk tale from Korea tells us how love can heal deep wounds, not quickly or easily, but with patience and courage.

Once Kim Soo-Nyung's life was filled with happiness. She and her husband, Liang-Po, one of the most **affable** of men, cultivated the fields of their small farm and raised three children with never an angry word spoken between them. But when war broke out, Liang-Po was forced to serve in the army even though he **abhorred** violence.

While he was away, Soo-Nyung and her three children worked hard to ensure the success of the farm. They took satisfaction in planting and harvesting, caring for the livestock, and keeping the farm buildings in good repair, all without outside help. The war, though, dragged on **interminably**; there were times when Soo-Nyung grew **despondent**, thinking she would never see Liang-Po again. But one day in the early spring, as she was drawing water from the well, she looked up to see him limping along the road toward the farm. Scarcely able to believe her eyes, Soo-Nyung rushed to greet him and welcome him home.

Her joy was short-lived, however, for it did not take long to see that something was **amiss**. There had been a **profound** change in Liang-Po. He, who always had been ready for a joke or a romp with his children, was now **irascible** and snapped at them without cause. He shut himself away like a **recluse**, responding to Soo-Nyung's pleas that he join her and the children for the evening meal with a stony silence. If she persisted, he would launch into a **tirade** that caused her to flee his presence. He took no interest in the farm, no pleasure in his family, and refused to talk about what troubled him. In time, Soo-Nyung, having lost patience with her husband, had no more dealings with him.

Liang-Po's mother, who lived in the next village, was distressed by her daughter-in-law's unhappiness. She persuaded Soo-Nyung to visit a local herbalist, a woman who was famous as much for her **sage** advice as for her herbal remedies. Soo-Nyung's sad story touched this woman's heart. "Your husband undoubtedly witnessed terrible scenes while in the army, for that is the nature of war," she told Soo-Nyung. "He is **haunted** by those memories. Fortunately there is a cure, but it requires a whisker plucked from a wild tiger. When you bring it to me, you shall have the remedy your husband needs."

In a **tremulous** voice, Soo-Nyung thanked the herbalist. The thought of facing a wild tiger filled her with dread, but she loved her husband, and this **impelled** her to follow the herbalist's instructions. She made her way to the tiger's lair, where she was greeted with a terrifying roar that **reverberated** through the forest. She fled in a panic, convinced that the wild beast was about to tear her limb from limb. Still, she found the courage to return the next day, this time with a piece of red meat. After smelling it suspiciously, the tiger devoured the meat.

Day after day, Soo-Nyung returned with more meat until the tiger grew so accustomed to her that she was finally able to rub its head and tickle its throat without being afraid. At last there came a day when she found the courage to reach out and pluck one of its whiskers. The tiger drew back and growled, but it did not attack her. Triumphantly, Soo-Nyung returned to the herbalist with the tiger's whisker, **entreating** her to prepare the remedy she needed.

The wise herbalist replied that Soo-Nyung had already found the cure. "If you can win the trust of a savage tiger," she said, "surely you can find the patience to regain the affection of your husband, whose heart has been hardened by war."

Soo-Nyung thanked the herbalist for teaching her a valuable lesson. In time her patience was rewarded when Liang-Po was restored to his former self.`,

*   The Latin word *ira*, meaning "anger," forms the root of several English words having related meanings. *Ire* is a synonym for *anger*. (In a carefully worded letter to the editor, James expressed his *ire* over the plans to build a mall in the center of town.) *Irate* and **irascible** are synonyms for *angry*. *Irate* suggests a single instance of becoming angry. (Karen became *irate* when she saw that someone had left the gate open to the horse pasture.) *Irascible* suggests a continuing inability to control one's anger.
