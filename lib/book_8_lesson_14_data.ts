    title: "Reading Passage: Leonardo da Vinci: Renaissance Man",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `The word *renaissance* means "rebirth." It is applied to the reawakening of interest in learning and the arts that began in Italy in the fifteenth century. This brought to an end the **millennium** known as the Middle Ages, during which learning and the arts **stagnated**. It is impossible to set precise dates for the Renaissance, but it began to flower around 1450. Its supreme genius is considered by many to be Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1517).

Leonardo was born in the small village of Vinci, near Florence. As a youth, he studied painting and drawing in the workshop of the distinguished teacher Andrea del Verrocchio. His **congenial** disposition soon made him a popular member of Florence's artistic circles. His extraordinary artistic ability, coupled with an **irrepressible** curiosity about the workings of nature, gave promise of his future greatness. His mind teemed with fresh ideas about music, science, and mathematics, a condition that exemplified the new spirit of the age. Leonardo did not learn from the ancient writings of classical Greece and Rome, which had long been regarded as **infallible** guides to everything from the movements of the heavens to the workings of the human body. Instead, Leonardo learned from the world he saw about him.

In his thirtieth year, Leonardo moved to Milan to serve as a military engineer at the court of Ludovico Sforza. Shortly after his arrival, the city was devastated by the **pestilence** known variously as the Plague or the Black Death. The traditional view was that such events were sent by God to punish the wicked. In contrast, Leonardo's idea was to clean up the slums in hopes of preventing this tragedy from happening again. He filled his **voluminous** notebooks with designs for many projects, including the layout of towns, the building of churches, and improvements in weapons of war. He even drew up plans for submarines and helicopters. He wrote his notes in a left-handed "mirror script"; the writing can be **deciphered** only by holding it to a mirror and reading its reflection.

Leonardo lived during a turbulent period. At that time, political power rested with individual city-states that **vied** with each other for supremacy. In 1499, the French, allied to the city-state of Venice and backed by Pope Alexander VI, invaded Milan. This ended Sforza's rule and caused Leonardo to flee the city. Two years before his departure, he had completed his painting of the *Last Supper* on a wall of a Milan convent. Most painters of that period applied the paint onto the plaster before it had dried. The technique was known as *fresco*. It gave a **luminous** quality to the finished work. In contrast, Leonardo painted the *Last Supper* on dry plaster, using paints he had created. The painting began to deteriorate slightly even during Leonardo's lifetime. Yet its dramatic composition and **sublime** spiritual quality have inspired awe in its viewers.

The second great work of art for which Leonardo is renowned is the portrait of a young woman whose **enigmatic** smile has intrigued people for centuries. This painting became known as the *Mona Lisa*. Leonardo painted it in 1503, following his return to Florence. Also dating from this period is a series of precise anatomical drawings made by Leonardo. At that time, knowledge of the workings of the human body was nonexistent. Doctors relied on centuries-old texts to treat disease, making medical treatment largely **ineffectual**. Leonardo obtained corpses from a Florence hospital and **dissected** over thirty of these in order to observe and make a record of their structure.

In 1513, Leonardo moved to Rome to work. However, he often became so **mired** in thinking about and recording the ideas running through his mind that he did not complete very many projects. Francis I, the enlightened young king of France, invited Leonardo to his country. There he remained the king's guest for the last two and a half years of his life. Out of gratitude, Leonardo gave the *Mona Lisa* to the young king. It has remained in France ever since. Each year the painting attracts people from all over the world to view it in Paris's Louvre museum.`,

*   You probably know that two thousands years is two *millenniums* (or *millennia*). Perhaps you didn't know that these words come from the Latin *mille*, "thousand," and *annus*, "year." Several other words share these roots. A *millimeter* is one one-thousandth of a meter; an *annual* event is one that takes place once a year.

*   To **dissect** something is to cut it apart. The word comes from the Latin *dis-*, "apart," and *secare*, "to cut." An *insect* is a creature that appears to be "cut into" sections—head, thorax, and abdomen. A *section* is a part "cut" from the whole.

*   **Pestilence** is a deadly disease. A *pest* is a nuisance or something that causes harm (such as a garden pest). To *pester* someone is to annoy that person. All three words comes from the Latin *pestis*, "plague."
