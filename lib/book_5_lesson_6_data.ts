# Fun & Fascinating FACTS

* Two nouns are formed from the verb **abolish**. *Abolition* is the act of abolishing or the state of being abolished. (It took the terrible Civil War to bring about the *abolition* of slavery in America.) An *abolitionist* is a person who worked to bring about an end to slavery. (William Lloyd Garrison was a famous *abolitionist* who, for thirty-five years, fought to end slavery in America.)

* Don't confuse the verb **loathe** (with a final -e) with the adjective *loath* (without the final -e) which means "unwilling." (We were having such a good time that we were *loath* to leave.) The *th* sound in *loathe* is pronounced as in *then*; the *th* sound in *loath* is pronounced as in *thin*.

* The homophones **meddle** and *medal* sound alike but have different meanings and spellings. A *medal* is a small, flat piece of metal given as an honor or to reward bravery.

* The Latin prefix *trans-* means "across" and helps form many English words. A *transatlantic* voyage is one made across the Atlantic Ocean. A radio or television tower *transmits* signals across the land to be picked up by radio and television sets.

* The Latin root *latus* means "to carry" or "to move." It combines with the prefix *trans-* to form **translate**. To *translate* something is to "move it across" from one language to another.`,

    content: `In the early nineteenth century, a number of Americans supported slavery, a practice that had been widely accepted since ancient times. Even people who **loathed** slavery, and there were a great many, thought that there was little that one person could do about it. They were wrong. Harriet Beecher Stowe, who was born in Litchfield, Connecticut, in 1811, was someone who caused important changes. She believed that slavery was a **monstrous** crime. While living in Ohio in the 1840s, she used her house to **harbor** enslaved people. These people had escaped from their Southern owners and were making their way north to freedom. In 1850, Harriet moved to Maine with her minister husband. There she wrote a novel called *Uncle Tom's Cabin*. The book not only awakened people to the horrors of slavery but also **catapulted** her to world fame.

Her book painted a **grim** picture of enslaved life. Readers shared the **agony** that the enslaved mother Eliza felt when she accidentally overheard that her only child was to be sold to a slave trader. They eagerly followed Eliza's adventures. First Eliza escaped with her child. Together they crossed the half-frozen Ohio River by jumping from one broken piece of ice to the next. Armed men and yelping dogs were close behind. Readers breathed a sigh of relief when Eliza and her child reached Canada and freedom.

Another **character** in the book is the wise and kindly enslaved man, Uncle Tom. He was sold to Simon Legree. Legree was a man who took pleasure in **inflicting** severe punishment on the people he enslaved. He ordered Uncle Tom to give a whipping to a sick and weak woman who had failed to pick enough cotton. Tom refused. So Legree had him whipped instead. Later, Uncle Tom **steadfastly** refused to tell Legree where two runaway enslaved people were hiding. Legree had him beaten so severely that he died. Readers wept.

*Uncle Tom's Cabin* sold millions of copies. It was **translated** into many different languages. It was also made into a stage play. The play was performed all over the world. The book helped **rouse** the people of America, especially those in the North, into demanding an end to slavery. Of course, not everyone looked with favor on *Uncle Tom's Cabin*. It was banned in the South. Slave owners and their supporters accused Harriet Beecher Stowe of **meddling** in their lives. She ignored their protests; she continued to **denounce** slavery in speeches, articles, and books.

The quarrel between the North and the South over the question of slavery **escalated**. In 1863, in the middle of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln signed an order **abolishing** slavery in states then under Confederate control. Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel played no small part in bringing about the war that ended slavery. Her life shows that just one determined person can make a difference.`,
