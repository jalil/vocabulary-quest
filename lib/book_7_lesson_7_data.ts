    title: "Reading Passage: The Midas Touch",
    type: "fiction",
    content: `It is sometimes said of people who are good at making money that everything they touch turns to gold. Such people are said to have the "Midas touch," an expression that comes from an ancient Greek myth.

The Greek god Dionysus was visiting Phrygia, now part of Turkey, when his companion Silenus wandered off and got lost, arriving some time later at the court of King Midas. He was exhausted, and he slipped off his donkey and fell asleep on the ground. When King Midas came upon him, he recognized Silenus at once and felt **privileged** to receive a visit from the friend of a god.

King Midas was determined to make his guest's stay a pleasant one. Midas's daughter presented Silenus with **garlands** made from flowers she herself had picked, and servants fell **prostrate** to the ground when he passed and rushed to obey his every **whim**. Musicians filled the air with sweet music wherever he went, and every night the king honored Silenus with a **lavish** banquet at which the most **delectable** dishes were served. In short, Midas did everything he could think of to **gratify** his guest. The **revelries** continued until Dionysus finally arrived in search of his companion.

Dionysus told Midas that in return for his kindness to Silenus, he could have anything he wanted. Now, King Midas loved gold almost as much as he loved his own daughter, so he did not stop to **ponder** Dionysus's offer. "Make everything I touch turn to gold," he said. When Dionysus suggested that Midas was being **impetuous**, the king **haughtily** rejected the suggestion. He was too proud to take advice from anyone, even a god. He refused to change his mind, so Dionysus granted him his wish.

Eager to try out his new power, King Midas rushed into the garden as soon as his visitors had left and **plucked** an apple from a tree. In an instant it turned to gold. The king was in a state of **rapture**. He called out to his daughter and flung his arms around her as he told her the good news. To his **consternation**, she instantly turned into a gold statue.

King Midas was aghast when he saw the consequences of his greed. He **beseeched** Dionysus to take back his gift. Dionysus agreed to do so, and he also restored the king's daughter to her human state. As for King Midas, he learned this important lesson: Be careful what you ask for; you might get it.`,

    content: `* The adjectives **prostrate** and *prone* both mean "lying with the face downward," but there is a difference between them that should be noted. **Prostrate** suggests either a show of respect or a state of helplessness. *Prone* is a more neutral term; it indicates bodily position and nothing more (*lying prone in a bed*). The antonym of *prone* is *supine*; it means "lying with the face upward."

* The Latin verb *rapere* means "to seize" and forms the root of several English words. To be in a state of **rapture** is to be seized by deep feelings of joy. The adjective *rapt* means "deeply absorbed." It is difficult to get the attention of people who are *rapt* in thought; it is as though their minds have been seized by thoughts that mentally disconnect them from what is going on around them. Finally, there is *raptor*, the name for a bird of prey that small animals or fish in its talons and carries them off to eat later. Hawks and eagles are *raptors*.

* In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, *whim-wham* was the name for a fanciful or amusing object worn as an ornament or decoration. The origin of the term is unknown, but it became shortened to **whim**, and its meaning was broadened so that a *whim* came to mean "a fanciful or amusing idea." *Whimsy* is a related word; it means "a fanciful or amusing quality." (*Alice in Wonderland* by Lewis Carroll is filled with *whimsy*.) The adjective form of *whimsy* is *whimsical*; it means "marked by whimsy; amusing or fanciful." (A battery-powered fork for twirling spaghetti was one of the *whimsical* objects on display.)`,
