    content: `The world's greatest climbers have always been drawn to **Mount Everest**. In trying to climb it, however, many have been **lured** to their deaths. Everest is located on the border of two Asian countries, Nepal and Tibet. It is part of the Himalayan mountain chain north of India. It is just over twenty-nine thousand feet high. Other mountains are more difficult to climb and offer a greater **challenge**. But because it is the world's highest mountain, Everest has a special place in our imaginations.

Every attempt to reach the top requires careful planning and can cost over a quarter of a million dollars. Often climbers hire Nepalese guides called Sherpas. Sherpas are skilled and experienced mountaineers. Together they work out the **route** to take and set up camps along the way.

Because the air is so thin near the top, climbers need to bring oxygen with them. This adds greatly to the weight that must be carried. In recent years, small groups of climbers have made attempts on Everest without oxygen and without relying on Sherpas. Their daring method has been to travel fast and light. They stay in **makeshift** shelters as they make their way up and down.

Where the mountain rises **vertically**, climbers drive spikes into **crevices** in the rock. Then they pull each other up with ropes. They must be very careful. A loose stone or even a loud noise can start an **avalanche**. An **avalanche** can bury those caught in its path or sweep them to their deaths.

In addition, climbers must be alert to the weather because it can change suddenly for the worse. **Blizzards** often strike with little warning. This forces climbers to scramble for **makeshift** shelter until the danger has passed.

The first people to reach the top of Mount Everest were Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, his Sherpa guide, in 1953. Teams of mountaineers had made at least eight **previous** tries; but all of them had been **thwarted** in their attempts to stand on the highest spot on Earth. Some had been plagued by bad planning, some by bad weather, and some by bad luck. The first woman to **conquer** Mount Everest was Junko Tabei, of Japan, in 1975; the first American woman to do so was Stacy Allison, in 1988.

Mountaineers are by nature **optimists**. They want to believe they will be able to reach the top. At times, however, if either their physical condition or the weather is deteriorating, they are forced to ask themselves if it would be **foolhardy** to continue. Their state of mind plays a big part in this decision. They must sometimes decide when they are only a few hundred feet from the **summit**. Many have chosen to continue, a decision that cost them their lives.

By 2015, Mount Everest had been climbed more than seven thousand times. That year, twenty-two climbers lost their lives making the attempt, the highest ever for a single year. In all, more than 250 people have died trying to reach the top. Why do it if it is so difficult and so dangerous? Someone once put this question to the English climber George Mallory. Mallory had made several unsuccessful tries to climb Mount Everest. He died there with less than six hundred feet to go, in 1924. He had answered the question with the **terse** reply, "Because it's there."`,
