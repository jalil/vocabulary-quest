    title: "Reading Passage: Mount Vernon",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `No visit to Washington, D.C., is complete without a trip to Mount Vernon, the **illustrious** home of George Washington, our nation's first president. It is located just a few miles south of our nation's capital. Its expansive views, spacious lawns, shaded walks, and carefully manicured gardens make it one of the most popular tourist attractions in the nation. More than a million people annually visit Mount Vernon. There they may pay respects to the memory of our first president and his wife, the first lady; both are buried there.

Mount Vernon had been in the Washington family for almost a hundred years when George Washington **inherited** the property in 1761. It **comprised** five separate farms as well as the main residence overlooking the Potomac River, which he occupied with his wife and her two children from a former marriage. Because the house was too small for their needs, Washington added rooms and outbuildings. Some of this work was completed by the 317 enslaved people Washington kept at Mount Vernon. He also hired paid workers and **supervised** their work closely; by the time they had finished, Mount Vernon had been transformed into the fine mansion visitors see today.

Washington was **loath** to leave his beautiful home. But his duty to his country required him to be absent from Mount Vernon from 1775 until 1783. During that time he commanded the Continental army in the war against the British. In his absence, a distant cousin, Lund Washington, managed the property for him. We know a great deal about this period in the history of Mount Vernon because the abundant **correspondence** between the two men has survived.

Washington gave his cousin considerable **latitude** in looking after the estate, and Lund was a **competent** manager. However, one **incident** aroused Washington's wrath. Lund informed him that a British warship had navigated up the river, and the crew had asked for food. Lund had not wanted to **antagonize** them and had complied with their request. Washington **reprimanded** his cousin, telling him that he should have refused to accommodate the British "even if they had burned my house and laid the Plantation in ruins."

In 1789, Washington reluctantly left Mount Vernon once again to serve as the country's first president. After eight years he retired from public life and returned for the last time to his beloved home. Two years later he died. The property remained in the Washington family until 1858. By then, the house was in a sadly **dilapidated** state. In that year, the Mount Vernon Ladies Association, an organization of private citizens, **acquired** the property. The association carefully **renovated** the house. It now looks as it did when George Washington lived there. The Mount Vernon Ladies Association has **maintained** it ever since and makes it available to the public to view every day of the year.`,

    content: `* The Latin *latus* means "broad" or "wide." The word **latitude** comes from this root. Latitude is measured in degrees of distance north or south of the equator. **Longitude** is measured in degrees east or west of an imaginary line going from the North Pole to the South Pole through Greenwich, England. (The first syllable comes from the Latin *longus*, meaning "long.") As you might imagine, lines of latitude run across the map and are "wide" or "broad"; lines of longitude run up and down the map and are "long."
    
* **Loath** and **loathe** are two different words. Use **loath** (rhymes with *both*) as an adjective meaning "unwilling." (I am **loath** to admit that I was wrong.) Use **loathe** (rhymes with *clothe*) as a verb meaning "to hate." (I **loathe** people who are cruel to animals.)`,
