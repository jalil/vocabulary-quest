    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `When European explorers returned from Asia and Africa in the Middle Ages, they reported having seen twelve-foot lizards with huge jaws that could eat a person whole. Most people who heard these stories were **incredulous** and accused the travelers of lying. The stories seemed **preposterous** to them. At that time hardly anyone in Europe had ever seen a crocodile. For centuries, travelers have been ridiculed for their reports of **exotic** creatures seen in distant lands. But the Komodo dragon of Indonesia, the giant panda of Western China, and the mountain gorilla of Ethiopia, to mention just three that were dismissed at one time as imaginary, really do exist.

More recently, there have been stories of Bigfoot, the **legendary** ape-like creature of the American Northwest. And Bigfoot's **counterpart** is said to live just below the snowline in the Himalayan Mountains of Asia. It is the yeti, also known as the Abominable Snowman. **Alleged** sightings, and even photographs, of both creatures make news periodically. Plaster casts have supposedly been made of their footprints. But the photographs are never sharp, the plaster casts could well be fakes, and the claims of those who say they have seen Bigfoot are not very **plausible**. Scientists have been **scrupulous** in their examination of the evidence. Their view is that it is not **conclusive**. Most remain unconvinced that Bigfoot and the yeti actually exist.

In spite of the scientists' findings, some people feel the need to believe that such creatures do exist. Such people are **enthralled** by the mysterious. They would like to think that somewhere deep in the forest, Bigfoot is **lurking**. They imagine that high in the Himalayas, a team of mountaineers is about to come upon the yeti. Supermarket tabloids **pander** to these people. They print headlines such as "Bigfoot Stole My Baby" or "Yeti Attacks Climbers on Mount Everest." Of course, only the most **naive** people believe such stories.

Given our **dismal** record of dealing with wild creatures, it would probably be best for Bigfoot and the yeti, if indeed they *are* real, to remain undiscovered. What would we do with them if we captured them? Such creatures do not belong in a **menagerie** to be peered at and photographed by sightseers. Such is the fate of the giant panda, the Komodo dragon, and the mountain gorilla. Bigfoot and the yeti are probably best left where they are now, creatures of our imagination, along with unicorns, fire-breathing dragons, and mermaids.`,

    content: `• **Exotic** comes from the Greek *exotikos*, which means "foreign" or "from the outside." (An *exotic* flower is one that comes from a foreign land.) The antonym, or word with the opposite meaning, is *indigenous*. This word comes from the Latin *indigena*, which means "native." (The turkey is **indigenous** to America, but the peach is an **exotic** fruit brought from China.)

• Someone who is **naive** is like a young child who has not yet learned the ways of the world. The word comes from the Latin *nativus*, "born," and in French means "native" or "natural." A number of English words share this root; among them are *native*, *nation*, *nature*, and *innate*.

• **Pander** comes from Pandarus, a character in Chaucer's poem *Troilus and Criseyde*, written in the late 1300s. In the story, Pandarus helps the hero win the love of Criseyde. The word came to mean a person who helps others satisfy their lower desires. It is now used as a verb and usually implies that one is lowering oneself to please others.`,
