# Fun & Fascinating FACTS

* The antonym of **edible** is *inedible*. (The food was so overcooked that it was *inedible*.) Another antonym is *poisonous*. (Cultivated mushrooms are *edible*, but some wild mushrooms are *poisonous*.)

* Don't confuse **hew** with *hue*, which is a color or shade of color. (Aqua is a blue color with a greenish *hue*.) These two words are homophones; they are pronounced the same but have different meanings and spellings.

* **Pledge** and *promise* are synonyms, but a *pledge* is a serious promise, made concerning something important. You might *promise* to meet a friend after school; you *pledge* allegiance to the flag of the United States.`,

    title: "The First Thanksgiving",

    content: `The hundred or so Pilgrims and other passengers who left England in 1620 aboard the *Mayflower* arrived at Plymouth, in what is now Massachusetts. Before going ashore, the forty-one male passengers **assembled** in the ship's main cabin. There they wrote the Mayflower Compact. Under this agreement, everyone, Pilgrims and non-Pilgrims alike, would be governed by the same laws. All those present **pledged** to observe the Compact.

The Pilgrims had come ashore at the end of December. They had to work fast to prepare for winter. Their first **task** was to build shelter to keep themselves safe from animals and bad weather. Soon the sound of axes rang out as trees were chopped down and **hewed** into logs. Next, the *Mayflower's* **cargo** had to be unloaded. There were root vegetables and lemons in crates, sacks of sugar and flour, and cider in **casks**. Also onboard were slabs of salt pork and beef, and seeds for planting in the spring. There were small items of furniture, and chests packed with blankets, linens, and clothes. There were family Bibles and tools of all kinds. But there were no musical instruments—the Pilgrims considered music and dancing to be **frivolous**.

That first winter was a grim one. Food was scarce. Many people became sick and died. By the time the *Mayflower* sailed back to England in the early spring, the number of people remaining had **decreased** to fewer than sixty. Many of that group were too feeble to work. Those who had survived the winter were also worried that the Native Americans would be **hostile** toward them as new settlers.

One spring day they were very surprised when a Native American walked into their settlement and greeted them in English. His name was Samoset; he explained that he had learned English from sea captains who had earlier explored the Atlantic coast. He told them of another man, Squanto, who also spoke English. A week or so later he returned with Squanto and sixty Wampanoags, who lived nearby. The colonists were glad that their visitors were friendly. With their food almost gone, their situation was **desperate**.

Because of the help of these native people, the colonists quickly learned which berries and other fruits were **edible**. They learned where to catch fish, and the best way to grow corn, beans, and squash. When they needed to talk with other native people, Squanto often acted as their translator.

Later in 1621, after the first **harvest**, the colonists held a **banquet** and invited Massasoit, the leader of the Wampanoags, to bring his people to **celebrate** with them. This was the first Thanksgiving; it lasted three days. The worst was now over for the colonists. When the *Mayflower* returned in 1622, it brought more people to join the colony. It also carried precious supplies. More ships arrived in the following years; the Plymouth colony grew in size and began to **prosper**. Its future was no longer in doubt.`,
