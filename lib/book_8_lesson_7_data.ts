    title: "Reading Passage: Women in Space, Part One",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `In 1959, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) introduced the first seven United States astronauts to the public. The announcement was made with great **fanfare**; it brought instant acclaim to the seven. All had previously been test pilots, and all were male.

Less than two decades later, things had changed tremendously. In 1978, another new **contingent** of aspiring astronauts arrived for training at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. On this occasion they included scientists, engineers, and medical doctors. In addition, six of the thirty-five **fledgling** astronauts were women.

At first, a **condescending** attitude toward women in the space program by some of the older men presented a rather troublesome problem. These space veterans felt that women lacked "the right stuff" to be astronauts. To **dispel** such prejudices, the women recognized the fact that they needed to perform as well as or better than their male counterparts. Candidates had to be smart, tough, and highly educated and had to be extraordinarily meticulous in everything they did. Physical strength, the one area where the men could often outperform the women, was not an important factor. During their year of basic training, the six women met the challenge. They proved their **mettle** in all essential situations.

Training to be an astronaut was a **daunting** task. The astronauts studied a range of subjects: astronomy, meteorology, geology, mathematics, navigation, and human anatomy. They spent hundreds of hours in the classroom learning the inner workings of every component of the space shuttle. Then they received hands-on experience in a **replica** of the space shuttle. The model was complete in even the smallest detail; therefore, the actual space shuttle was comfortably familiar to the astronauts, even when they went aboard for the first time.

Trainee astronauts spent time underwater to simulate the effects of weightlessness they would experience in space. They also endured flights aboard K-135 planes, which flew almost vertically upward before turning back along a **protracted** flight path that curved toward the earth. This produced a sensation of weightlessness. These flights also gave other sensations, which led to the nauseated trainees **dubbing** the aircraft "the vomit comet."

A critically important component of the program was survival training, both on land and at sea. What if the space shuttle's rocket engines and their backup systems failed while it was in orbit? The chance of this happening was **negligible**; still, the astronauts had to be prepared for every remote possibility. They practiced climbing inside fabric rescue balls that were thirty inches in diameter and could be rapidly inflated with oxygen. In an emergency, an astronaut would sit inside a ball waiting to be transferred to a rescue vehicle. Climbing into one of these was very unpleasant, especially for an individual suffering even a mild form of **claustrophobia**. Fortunately, it was decided that the ball was not a good solution and never flew on any shuttles.

Finally, in the spring of 1982, one of the six women graduates of the space program was chosen for Space Transportation System 7. She was Sally Ride, a scientist with an advanced degree in physics from Stanford University. Her areas of expertise were X-ray astronomy and lasers. As soon as the announcement was made, NASA was **deluged** with requests for interviews with the first American woman to venture into space. Dr. Ride cheerfully submitted to endless questions from reporters. She answered even the most **inane** questions with patience and good humor.

After the flood of publicity came a further year of intensive training geared to the specific requirements of the mission for which she had been chosen. Then, on June 18, 1983, along with four male **colleagues**, Dr. Sally Ride began her historic five-day flight aboard the space shuttle *Challenger*.`,

*   Old Norse was a northern European language spoken in Scandinavia until the fourteenth century. The Old Norse word *dubben* means "to strike" and was given a particular meaning when it was brought into English. A monarch, in the act of naming a person a knight, would strike that person lightly on the shoulder with a sword while saying, "I **dub** thee Sir _______," along with the person's name. The word came to mean "to give a title to" and was later broadened to its present, more general, meaning.
