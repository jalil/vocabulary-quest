    title: "Reading Passage: The Spanish Conquest of Mexico",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `For over two hundred years, until it was overthrown by Spanish invaders in 1519, the Aztec empire in Mexico was a prosperous and highly cultivated society. Many arts and sciences **flourished**; the Aztecs developed astronomy, mathematics, engineering, agriculture, sculpture, and music to a far higher degree than did the Europeans of that **era**. At the same time, they were a warlike people, **ruthless** in battle, and their religious beliefs involved acts of extreme cruelty. Prisoners of war were offered as human **sacrifices** to their many gods. The Aztecs believed that the gods had already destroyed the world four times, and unless they were **placated** in this way, they would destroy it again.

The Aztecs were originally a **nomadic** people who lived mainly by hunting. Around the year 1300, they settled on an island on Lake Texcoco. The land there was wet and swampy, but the Aztecs drained the marshes and became farmers. Their **principal** crop was corn; they also grew beans, squash, and chili peppers. Over a two-hundred-year period, they created an empire extending across central Mexico from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific. Its capital was Tenochtitlán, which we know today as Mexico City. In 1500, Tenochtitlán was **inundated** by a terrible flood that drowned many of its people. After the floodwaters had **receded**, the Aztecs quickly rebuilt their city, but a far worse catastrophe was to follow.

In 1519, a Spanish explorer named Hernando Cortéz landed in Mexico with an army of six hundred soldiers. He established a **garrison** in what is now the city of Veracruz on Mexico's east coast. His plan was to destroy the Aztec army and take over their country for Spain. Because horses were unknown to the Aztecs, they were **dumbfounded** by the sight of people on horseback. They believed the Spanish soldiers to be gods and therefore **invincible**. Fighting them, the Aztecs thought, would be pointless. So Montezuma, the Aztec emperor, allowed the Spaniards to take over his city without any resistance. Cortéz now gave the orders and Montezuma became a prisoner in his own palace. The Spanish discovered a great **hoard** of gold and silver there. It was later loaded onto Spanish ships and sent to Spain. It is believed that much of the treasure was lost at sea.

When word came that Spanish soldiers had been killed in an attack on Veracruz, the Aztecs realized that they had made a **grievous** error in their previous thinking. These strange creatures were not gods after all! A battle **ensued** in Tenochtitlán, and although Montezuma was killed, the Aztecs drove the Spanish from their city. But their victory was only temporary. Cortéz returned in 1521 with another army that laid siege to Tenochtitlán. After eighty days, the city was forced to surrender. The rule of the Aztecs in Mexico had ended; Spanish rule had begun.`,

    content: `* **Flourish** and *flower* (as verbs) are synonyms; both can mean "to thrive." We can say that the arts *flourished*, or *flowered*, in Athens in the fifth century B.C.E. Both words come from the Latin *flos*, which means "a flower."

* Don't confuse **hoard**, "something stored away secretly," with *horde*, "a large crowd or swarm." These two words are homophones; they sound the same but have different spellings and meanings.

* Don't confuse **principal** with *principle*, which has three meanings: (1) "a rule or truth by which we govern ourselves" (The *principle* of the separation of church and state traces to the First Amendment.); (2) "a truth from which other truths can be worked out" (One *principle* of plane geometry is that parallel lines never meet.); (3) "a rule or law that explains how something works" (An electric bell works on the *principle* of the continuous making and breaking of an electric current.).`,
