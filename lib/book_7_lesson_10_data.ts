    title: "Reading Passage: Danger: Manatees at Play",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `The subject of manatees takes us far back in the history of both natural science and imaginative storytelling. Manatees have been in existence for fifty million years. This sea animal was probably what sailors were seeing long ago when they reported visions of mermaids sunning themselves on rocks far in the distance.

Closer observation of the manatee shows it to be a **ponderous** mammal. It measures from eight to twelve feet in length and weighs up to three thousand pounds. The manatee's tapered body, shaped somewhat like that of an overgrown seal or miniature whale, has two front legs and a broad flat tail. The legs and the tail all act as flippers.

Manatees live singly or in small groups. They can eat two hundred pounds of food a day, grazing contentedly on water hyacinths and other **aquatic** plants. A manatee sometimes may stand up straight in the water, often with strings of sea plants hanging like hair from its head.

In the United States, Florida's coastal waters are the manatee's principal habitat. These sea creatures are quite **docile** by nature. In fact, they have no fear of humans; they seem to love company! Manatees allow swimmers to play alongside them, something that is discouraged by game wardens.

Manatees feed just below the surface. They are often unobserved by speeding boaters who may go **blithely** on their way, ignorant of the terrible injuries they have just inflicted. Being struck by a high-speed propeller can be **lethal**; almost a third of all manatee deaths are boat-related. Wildlife wardens estimate that ninety percent of all adult manatees have been **mutilated** by the propellers of speeding boats. The reasons for this are not entirely clear—perhaps the manatees have poor hearing and are unaware of a boat's approach. Perhaps they are simply not **nimble** enough to get out of the way in time.

Because of the enormous increase in the number of powerboats in Florida, for years the manatee population **dwindled**, and the animal's prospects of survival were **bleak**. These creatures were on the **verge** of extinction. But people have become more aware of the **plight** of the manatee. Laws such as the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibit harming manatees. More needs to be done, though. People operating powerboats in areas where manatees live need to be more **vigilant**. If they were, many collisions could be **averted**. And speed limits need to be strictly enforced, even though people whose livelihood depends on the boating industry **assert** that too much regulation would cause economic hardship.

Still, something amazing has happened. In recent years, because Florida authorities carefully **monitored** the manatee population and took actions to protect them, an aerial survey showed that more than six thousand manatees now inhabit the area's waters. Manatees were removed from the endangered species list in 2016.`,

    content: `* The Latin word for *water* is *aqua* and forms the root of the adjective **aquatic**. Other words formed from this root include nouns such as *aquarium* and *aqueduct*, "a large pipe or channel for water." You might guess that the word *aquiline* comes from the same Latin root. Actually, it comes from a different Latin word altogether, *aquila*, which means "eagle." An *aquiline* nose is one that is curved like an eagle's beak.

* The ancient Greeks believed that the dead went to the underworld, where they bathed in the river Lethe, which caused them to forget their earthly lives. The Latin word *letum*, "death," comes from the name of the river and forms the English adjective **lethal**, "capable of causing death" (a *lethal* weapon).

* The noun **plight** carries with it a reminder of love and marriage in centuries past. Once it was a verb and meant "to promise; to pledge." When two people got engaged to be married, they "*plighted* their *troth*." This means they would dishonor themselves if they were not faithful and true to each other. *Troth* is a word that is no longer in use, meaning "loyalty; faithfulness; honor." It still appears as part of the word *betroth*, meaning "to promise to marry."

* Several words come from the Latin *vigilare*, "to be watchful." In addition to **vigilant**, there is *vigil*, a watch kept during normal hours of sleep (Parents keep a *vigil* by the bedside of a very sick child.) and *vigilante*, a person who takes the law into her or his own hands, usually as part of a group.`,
