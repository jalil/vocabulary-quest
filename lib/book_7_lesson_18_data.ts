    title: "Reading Passage: A Raisin in the Sun",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `When Lorraine Hansberry's play *A Raisin in the Sun* opened in New York on March 11, 1959, it was a **momentous** day in the history of the American theater. *A Raisin in the Sun* was the first play written by an African American woman to appear on Broadway. It opened up the American theater to African Americans and broadened people's **perceptions** of the African American experience in society.

The reviews were **overwhelmingly** favorable. Even its **staunchest** supporters could not have predicted the impact the play would have on the American theater. It went on to win the **coveted** New York Drama Critics Circle award for Best Play of the Year. The opposition for the award was **formidable**, including works by two of America's greatest playwrights, Tennessee Williams and Eugene O'Neill.

*A Raisin in the Sun* is about African Americans confronting **oppression** in their daily lives, a **theme** that Hansberry was painfully familiar with in her own life. In 1938, her parents bought a house in an all-white neighborhood. The **bigotry** of their new neighbors resulted in a legal battle over property rights. A lower court ordered the Hansberrys to move out. They fought the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and won, but the family suffered terribly in the process. Prejudice quickly escalated into violence. When Lorraine was eight years old, she was almost killed by a concrete slab, thrown by an angry neighbor, that narrowly missed her head.

Hansberry's play tells the story of Lena Younger, who has received ten thousand dollars from her recently **deceased** husband's life insurance. Her dream is to move her family of five out of their cramped and rundown apartment in Chicago's South Side **ghetto**. She wants to use the money to buy a home in a white neighborhood, but doing that is not so simple.

Mrs. Younger is pressured by her son Walter to give him the money to improve his own financial state. Walter wants to invest in a store. At the same time, her daughter Beneatha needs money; her dream is to attend medical school. Mrs. Younger decides to try to keep the family together by making a down payment on a house with about one-third of the money. She gives the remaining sum to Walter under the condition that he set aside $3,000 for his sister's tuition; the rest he may use as he wishes.

Walter, however, uses all the money to pay a partner to buy the store for him. The partner runs off with the money, leaving the family with nothing but their new house. Their future neighbors are **spurning** the idea of having African Americans live among them; they send a white lawyer to try to buy the house back from the Youngers. Walter is desperate to get back the money he lost and thinks he should accept the lawyer's offer. He finally decides, however, that the family has too much pride to be bought off. They will move into their new home and face whatever the future holds.

The play's title comes from a poem by Langston Hughes. He asks, "What happens to a dream deferred / Does it dry up / Like a raisin in the sun?" The Youngers' dream does not dry up. It becomes a reality because they would not let themselves be defeated.

Sadly, Lorraine Hansberry had but a short time to enjoy her **acclaim**. She died of cancer in 1965 at the age of thirty-four. Her second play, *The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window*, had its **premiere** shortly before her death.`,

    content: `• **Premiere** comes from the Latin *primus*, meaning "first." (Other words formed from this root include *primary*, *primate*, *primitive*, and *prime*.) The *premier* (notice the different spelling) is the person who ranks first in a government, such as a prime minister. A nation's *premier* trade partner is the country with which it does the most business.

• The word **covet** is most familiar from the Tenth Commandment: "Thou shalt not *covet* thy neighbor's house ... nor anything that is thy neighbor's." To *covet* something is to want it obsessively regardless of who owns it; to *envy* someone is to want what that person has.

• **Ghetto** was the name of the island near Venice where Jews were forced to live. It was formerly the place where cannon were cast. The Italian word for "to cast" is *gettare*, and *ghetto* is a noun formed from this verb.`,
