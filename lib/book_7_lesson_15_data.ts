    title: "Reading Passage: Bluegrass",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `To horse lovers, the word *bluegrass* **conjures** up a picture of Kentucky's **lush** blue-green pastures, home of champion racehorses; but to lovers of country music, bluegrass is the lively sound of fiddles, banjos, mandolins, and guitars playing together in rapid foot-stompin', hand-clappin' harmony. Its roots go back many years to the Scottish and Irish immigrants who settled in the Appalachian region. These settlers brought their traditional tunes and songs with them. In the days before television, movies, and radio, families were **obliged** to supply their own entertainment. Anyone who could scrape a tune from a fiddle or **warble** a song would be invited to join in.

After the Civil War, African Americans, freed from slavery, found jobs in Appalachia. They worked as coal miners, loggers, and railroad construction workers. They also introduced their music to the people of Appalachia, bringing in the "banjar," an African four-stringed instrument. The banjar was made from a hollowed gourd with a neck attached. Its twanging sound **complemented** the traditional fiddle so well that over time it was developed into the modern banjo. By the end of the nineteenth century, the guitar had been added, brought to Appalachia by city musicians traveling in bands through the region. All the **components** of bluegrass music were now in place. Its distinctive sound was beginning to emerge, although it did not yet have a name.

At first, the music coming out of Appalachia was ignored by most Americans, who criticized its lack of **subtlety**. They thought of it as music that would appeal only to **rustics**. This impression was often created by the musicians themselves. They enjoyed combining slapstick comedy with their musical **medleys**. The coming of radio in the 1920s put more **emphasis** on the music itself and brought it a wider audience and more general acceptance. Together with recorded music, radio offered greater commercial opportunities. Musicians were no longer content to play the fiddle or the guitar merely as a hobby. More and more began to make music their **vocation**. Among them was Bill Monroe, who was born in western Kentucky in 1911. Bill showed his **prowess** with the mandolin at an early age. In 1938, he formed a band and named it after the nickname of his native state—the Blue Grass Boys. Over the years that followed, the name of Monroe's band lent itself to the distinctive sound he had created. Monroe and his Blue Grass Boys continued to perform until he was in his eighties, although he reduced the number of festival performances from 150 to 100 per year. On September 9, 1996, four days before his eighty-fifth birthday, Bill Monroe died.

Bluegrass festivals are held in just about every state in the union and in many foreign countries. These musical events are not at all **pretentious**; in fact, performers mix freely with their fans. Those attending enjoy taking out their own instruments to join in **impromptu** performances held in any open space between campers. Many also come to pay **homage** to Bill Monroe, the father of bluegrass.`,

    content: `• **Complement** is a noun and a verb. *Compliment* (with an *i*) is also a noun and a verb, but these two words have quite different meanings. A *compliment* is a remark that expresses praise, approval, or admiration. To *compliment* someone is to make such a remark.

• We sometimes refer to a person's profession, occupation, or chosen way of life as a *calling*. (Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has combined the *callings* of motherhood and the law.) *Calling* and **vocation** are synonyms, and this is no surprise because **vocation** comes from the Latin *vocare*, which means "to call." The prefix *a-* means "away from," and an *avocation* is a hobby or pastime, something done "away from" one's work or calling.`,
