    title: "Reading Passage: How the Seasons Changed",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `It is universally acknowledged that the seasons occur because Earth, as it travels in its yearly **orbit** around the sun, has its northern hemisphere tilted away from the sun during northern winters and toward the sun during northern summers. The ancient Greeks were considerably less **enlightened** in matters of astronomy than we are today. They put forward a different explanation. It was expressed in one of their myths about the goddess Demeter and her daughter Persephone.

The ancient Greeks believed that the gods **intervened** frequently in human affairs and often did so in a **capricious** manner. They were **inclined** to regard human mortals as mere playthings. Demeter, whose name means "earth mother," was different. She was a benevolent goddess who had bestowed upon humans the invaluable gift of agriculture, which provided them with most of the **necessities** of life. The ancient Greeks considered the island of Sicily especially **sacred** as they believed it was there that Demeter had first given corn to humans. Women, who tilled the fields and planted the crops while the men hunted, were among her most **devout** followers.

According to the myth, Persephone was **abducted** by Hades, the god of the underworld, while she was in a meadow with her friends picking flowers. Hades suddenly erupted from an **abyss** that he created at her feet and carried Persephone off to his home: the **abode** of the dead. There he made her his wife. **Distraught** over the loss of her daughter, Demeter searched for her everywhere. When at last she determined what had happened, Demeter demanded that Persephone be returned to her. Hades refused. He argued that Persephone had consumed the seeds of a pomegranate while in the underworld. Anyone who had eaten food there was destined to remain.

Unable to agree on a solution to the problem, Demeter and Hades called upon Zeus, the ruler of the gods, to **arbitrate** the dispute. Demeter threatened to make the earth barren unless her daughter was restored to her. Zeus did not want to lose the humans who worshipped him, so he worked out a **compromise**. Persephone would live part of each year in the underworld with Hades. The remainder of the year she would spend in the human world with her mother.

And so, we see, it is to Demeter's moods that the ancient Greeks **attributed** the changing of the seasons. During the summer months, when the land is scorched by the hot southern sun and the crops wither in the heat, Persephone was presumed to be in the underworld with Hades. During the mild, moist months from fall to spring when the earth is fruitful, she was living with her mother.`,

    content: `• **Abyss** comes from the Greek *bussos*, which means "bottom," combined with the prefix *a-*, which means "without." The adjective formed from it is *abysmal*, which means "too deep or too great to be measured." Because this adjective is often used to modify negative qualities (*abysmal* ignorance, *abysmal* poverty), it has acquired a secondary meaning, "very bad" or "wretched." (The choir's *abysmal* performance was the result of inadequate preparation.)

• The adjective **distraught** is formed from the Latin verb *trahere*, "to draw" or "pull," combined with the prefix *dis-*, "apart." To be *distraught* is to be so agitated or upset that one's attention is likely to be drawn away from or pulled apart from whatever might otherwise engage it. The verb *distract* is formed in the same way. To be *distracted* is to have one's attention drawn away from whatever ought to engage it. (The band playing in the street outside *distracted* me from my studies.) A person who is *distraught* experiences strong emotion; this is not necessarily the case with a person who is *distracted*.`,
