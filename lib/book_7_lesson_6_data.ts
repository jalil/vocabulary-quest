    title: "Reading Passage: Out of Her League?",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `Pam Postema grew up in Willard, Ohio, hooked on sports and with an unusual ambition—she **aspired** to be a major-league baseball umpire. At the time, this seemed like an impossible dream. No one took her seriously. Postema persisted, however, and in 1977 **enrolled** in the country's top umpiring school. At that time, she was twenty-two and well aware of the strong **bias** against women in professional baseball. Although the school she chose to attend had previously accepted several women, none had completed the course. In its entire history, the school had graduated seven thousand men but not one woman!

The umpiring school's chief instructor treated Postema fairly, and he was also very **candid** with her. He told her that her chances of getting a top job in the future were slim. In order to make it into the major leagues, she would have to be twice as good as any man. Postema was determined to succeed, and she did well at the school, graduating seventeenth out of a class of over a hundred students. She began at once to look for a job as a professional baseball umpire.

Within a few months, Postema made her professional **debut** with the Gulf Coast Single A League. During the next few years, she advanced steadily. In 1983, she began calling plays in the Triple A Pacific League, one step below the majors. It was not easy, though. If a male umpire made a bad call, it was brushed aside. If Postema did the same thing, she was accused of becoming **flustered**. Some baseball fans seized on any errors she made as "proof" that umpiring was not an appropriate occupation for a woman.

Postema believed that a manager would often view a **confrontation** with her as a test of his manhood; if he failed to **intimidate** her, he felt somehow disgraced. She wanted to show that no one should expect to attack her authority with **impunity**, so she ejected managers and players from the game at twice the rate of other umpires. She even had three spectators thrown out of the ballpark for making **obnoxious** remarks about female umpires. Postema admits she sometimes enjoyed arguing, whether with managers, players, or even other umpires. In fact, she says that many umpires are **addicted** to arguing.

In 1988, Postema got a job umpiring the National League spring-training games, where she had to deal with major-league players and managers. When the starting pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates told a reporter that God never intended women to be major-league baseball umpires, Postema **retorted** that she doubted that God was interested in baseball. Not everyone was as **blatant** as the Pirates' pitcher. But the hostility directed against her, far from diminishing, seemed to **intensify** as her career advanced.

Pam Postema's career as a professional baseball umpire was marked by talent and spirit. Her **stint** in the minors had lasted seven years when she was dropped from the official list of umpires. There was nothing unusual about this. After about five years in the minors, most umpires are let go to give others a chance; very few make it into the majors. Did Pam Postema fail? Let's ask Ria Cortesio. In 2007, eighteen years after Pam retired from the game, Ria became the second woman to umpire a spring training game. She was the first to give credit to Pam Postema for leading the way.`,

    content: `* The Latin word *candidus* means "white." (The word *candidate* comes from this root also; in ancient Rome, a man running for public office wore a white toga.) In English, **candid** means "honesty"; this suggests that someone who is *candid* is "white," or "pure," and has nothing to hide.

* In 1912, the *Titanic* made its first and last voyage across the Atlantic. We could also say that the ship made its **debut** and its swan song at the same time. This is because *debut*, a French word that has been absorbed into English, means "a first public appearance," while *swan song*, a term based on the old belief that swans sing only once—just before they die—is used to describe a person's or thing's final public appearance.`,
