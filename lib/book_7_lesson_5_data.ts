    title: "Reading Passage: Harvest of Shame",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `Many Americans are lucky to have access to ample supplies of fruits and vegetables in their supermarkets twelve months a year. And who harvests all this food? More than a million women, children, and men do. They crisscross the United States picking asparagus and strawberries in Washington State, **citrus** fruits in Florida, apples in New York State, and a host of different fruits and vegetables in California. These laborers are called migrant farmworkers because they move from place to place, wherever crops need picking. Most would prefer **permanent** full-time employment, but it is not often available to them.

The workday is **strenuous**; pickers bend and stoop, often under a blazing hot sun. And the day is exceptionally long—from seven in the morning until seven at night. Their only **respite** may be a twenty-minute lunch break. It is considered **menial** work; wages are low, and laborers are paid only when they pick. If it rains, or if they are too sick to work, they get nothing. What's more, they often have difficulty obtaining **adequate** medical treatment when they are ill or injured.

The children suffer enormous disadvantages because their education is **disrupted** as they move from school to school. In fact, only one student in ten graduates from high school. Young people often drop out of school altogether to **toil** in the fields alongside their parents. It is there that they may be exposed to the chemical pesticides that are routinely sprayed on crops. One California study demonstrated that the cancer rate among migrant workers' children was twelve times the national average rate.

In the 1960s, laborers in California began to **agitate** for more progressive working conditions. The growers were **indifferent** to their demands. So the migrant workers, under the leadership of two Mexican Americans, Cesar Chavez and Dolores Fernandez Huerta, formed a labor union called the United Farm Workers of America. When growers tried to oppose the union, it called strikes and organized boycotts of California lettuce and grapes. There were years of struggle, many organized marches, and sometimes violent clashes, but in the end the majority of growers **capitulated**. In 1966, they recognized the union's right to represent workers.

Despite the union's efforts, conditions have improved minimally since the 1960s. One notable accomplishment has been the creation of the East Coast Migrant Head Start Project, which **administers** many childcare centers for migrants. Started in 1974, it now serves over three thousand children annually along the East Coast. Motivation, Education & Training (MET) is a similar program that helps migrant workers in five states. Though these programs have helped improve conditions in some areas, the need for additional programs is **urgent**. Educational programs could lower **illiteracy** rates among migrant workers and their families, while outreach programs could help improve migrant workers' living conditions. Many workers survive without running water or electricity. These necessary additions and repairs to homes would help convert them from inadequate **hovels** into acceptable community housing.

In 1960, a CBS documentary film about migrant workers aired on television the day after Thanksgiving. It brought into people's homes the truth about how the nation's crops were harvested, and it shocked the nation. Fifty years later, in 2010, CBS television broadcast a program to mark the occasion. It showed that while there had been some improvement in wages and working conditions, much remains to be done. The name of the documentary film is *Harvest of Shame*.`,

    content: `* The noun formed from the verb **administer** is *administration*; its general meaning is "the management of a business," but it also has a specialized meaning, "the members of the executive branch of government, headed by the president." In this meaning, the word is usually capitalized. (During the Clinton *Administration*, Janet Reno became the first female Attorney General of the United States.) The other two branches of government are the legislative (the Senate and the House of Representatives) and the judicial (headed by the United States Supreme Court).

* The Latin word for *break* is *ruptura*; from this word, we form the verbs **disrupt** and *interrupt*. If you *interrupt* a speaker, you *break* in on what that person is saying. If you try to **disrupt** a meeting, you are attempting to *break* it up.

* The antonym of **illiterate** is *literate*. Its primary meaning is "able to read," but it has two secondary meanings: "well read" (a *literate* scholar), and "well written; polished" (a *literate* essay).`,
