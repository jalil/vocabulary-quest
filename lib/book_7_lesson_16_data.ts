    title: "Reading Passage: Harbor Seals",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `Because they live in close **proximity** to the shore, harbor seals are a familiar sight along the New England coast. You may have to look closely to see them because their coloring provides them with a good **camouflage**; their gray and black **mottled** coats are hard to see against the seaweed-covered rocks on which they spend much of their time. During the winter months, they inhabit the waters around Cape Cod and along the Massachusetts shoreline. Their dense fur and thick layer of blubber keep them so well **insulated** that in summer they seek the colder waters of Maine and the Atlantic provinces of Canada.

Harbor seals are equally at home on land and in the water. As the tide **ebbs**, they climb onto rocks along the shoreline. They return to the water at high tide to **forage** for crabs, fish, and squid. Harbor seals may seem **lethargic** as they lie basking in the sun, but actually they are **replenishing** their blood supply with fresh oxygen. Whether hunting for food or escaping from sharks and killer whales, harbor seals burn up oxygen rapidly when they are in the water.

Because of their **sleek** bodies and powerful rear flippers, harbor seals can swim up to fifteen miles an hour. They can also **maneuver** swiftly. They use their front flippers to brake and steer. Their excellent eyesight is necessary for survival. Harbor seals must watch for predators in the **murky** New England waters. Healthy harbor seals that stay out of harm's way can live for thirty years.

An adult harbor seal weighs over two hundred pounds and eats up to twenty pounds of fish a day. This makes the seals unpopular with those who fish for a living. In fact, seals were so unpopular in the 1800s that the state of Maine offered a **bounty** of five dollars for every harbor seal killed. Then the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 made harbor seals a protected species. The Act was updated in 1994. It is now against the law to kill, capture, or **harass** them in any way.

Female harbor seals give birth in late May and early June. Newborn pups weigh about twenty pounds. They feed on their mother's milk until they are **weaned** at six to eight weeks. Within hours of being born, they are able to swim and are completely at home in the water. Young seals stay close to their mothers. The mothers keep a **wary** eye on them until they are able to take care of themselves.

Some seals who run into problems can be seen by visitors to the New England Aquarium in Boston. Sick or injured seals that could not survive in the wild are brought there for medical treatment. They are kept in a holding tank outside the building. Once restored to health, the harbor seals are released into the ocean to enjoy its limitless freedom but also to face whatever dangers lurk there.`,

    content: `• **Camouflage** is a French military term that has entered English while retaining its original French spelling and pronunciation.

• **Harass** is sometimes pronounced *ha rass'* and sometimes *har' ess*. While both pronunciations are correct, the second is considered preferable by many dictionaries.

• In some situations, **ebb** and *flow* are antonyms. For example, we speak of the *ebb and flow*, or falling and rising of the tide. (The science teacher explained that the tide *ebbs and flows* twice approximately every twenty-four hours.)`,
