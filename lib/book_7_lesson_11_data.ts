    title: "Reading Passage: Exploring Earth's Last Frontier",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `By the middle of the twentieth century, the earth's continents had been explored from pole to pole. But even though water covers three-quarters of the earth's surface, much of the deep ocean floor remained a mystery. Auguste Piccard, a Belgian scientist whose curiosity was **piqued** by the unknown, changed that. In 1932, he had broken the world's altitude record by going ten miles up in a balloon. He next planned to design and build a vessel to explore the deepest parts of the ocean.

On October 26, 1948, Piccard made his first dive off the coast of Africa in a bathyscaphe, a large, hollow, **spherical** vessel made of thick steel. The word comes from two Greek words: *bathys*, "deep," and *scaphe*, "a light boat." The bathyscaphe could descend into the inky blackness of the ocean depths. With its powerful searchlights, it could **probe** the ocean floor. Those inside were able to look out through windows made of thick layers of acrylic plastic. **Buoyancy** was provided by huge tanks containing gasoline, which is lighter than seawater. The vessel hung beneath these tanks. Iron weights fixed to the outside of the hull by magnets were used as **ballast**, causing the bathyscaphe to descend.

The first test dive was made in water where the seabed lay just twelve **fathoms** below the surface. Piccard and the other crew member were bolted inside the bathyscaphe, which was then slung over the side of the support ship and **submerged**. As the vessel sank below the surface, it filled with an **eerie** blue light created by sunlight passing through the water. It took just a few minutes for the two pioneers of underwater exploration to reach the ocean floor. Shortly afterward, Piccard **detached** the iron weights; the bathyscaphe rose to the surface.

Several hours passed while the gasoline tanks were emptied; this had to be completed before the two men were able to **clamber** out of their cramped quarters. Despite the **tedious** wait, Piccard was a happy man. His mind was already on his **ultimate** dream, to explore the very deepest part of the ocean. He was asked later if he had been afraid during the descent. He replied that he had total confidence in the design and the construction of the vessel he had invented, and, therefore, he had no reason to be afraid.

Twelve years later, Piccard's son Jacques **realized** his father's dream. He and a United States naval officer descended seven miles in a newer, larger, and stronger bathyscaphe to explore the deepest part of the Pacific Ocean. They knew that if there were a single defect in the metal, the enormous pressure would cause cracks to develop. That would **rupture** the vessel and crush them both. There was no way for them to escape if anything went wrong. Thankfully, the two crew members emerged **unscathed** after their great adventure. Jacques Piccard's father, who at the age of seventy-six was considered too old to make the descent himself, was waiting on the recovery vessel and was the first to greet them.`,

    content: `• The fact that the same word can be used as a unit of measurement and as a synonym for *understand* might at first seem strange. With the word **fathom**, however, the connection is easy to see. Sailors wanting to know the depth of the water would drop a weighted line, marked off in *fathoms*, or six-foot lengths, over the side of the boat. When the weight reached the bottom, the length of line indicated how deep the sea was at that point. Sailors would say that they had "*fathomed*" its depth. By extension, a person who was able to "get to the bottom of" something unknown or puzzling was said to have *fathomed* the mystery.

• The word itself has an interesting history; it comes from the Old English *faethm*, the distance from fingertip to fingertip of a tall person's outstretched arms. In many cases, this is about six feet.

• The word **sphere** comes from the Greek word for a ball, which is *sphaira*. By combining *sphere* with the Greek word *hemi* ("half"), we get *hemisphere*, which is half of a *sphere*. Earth is divided into a northern *hemisphere* (everywhere north of the equator) and a southern *hemisphere* (everywhere south of the equator). Earth can also be divided into an eastern *hemisphere* and a western *hemisphere*.`,
