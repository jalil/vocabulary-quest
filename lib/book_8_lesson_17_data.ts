    title: "Reading Passage: The Country Without an Army",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `At the close of the ceremony honoring him, the dark-haired, **impeccably** dressed forty-six-year-old passed among the many **dignitaries** gathered at San José's Metropolitan Cathedral. He stopped before a frail, elderly man, who had tears of joy streaming down his cheeks, and embraced him. On this occasion, Costa Ricans had gathered to celebrate their president, Oscar Arias Sánchez. Arias was about to leave for Oslo to receive the 1987 Nobel Prize for Peace.

This award was to be **conferred** upon Arias because he was the main architect of an **accord** known as "The Arias Peace Plan." It was signed that year by representatives from Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Honduras. It **affirmed** the intentions of these countries to make a strong effort to end the armed conflict that had **embroiled** parts of Central America for decades. Arias was uniquely qualified to initiate this effort; for almost forty years, his country had enjoyed both domestic tranquility and a democratic political system. Both of these blessings had been **bequeathed** to Costa Rica by its former president José Figueres Ferrer, the man Arias now embraced.

In the early 1940s, Figueres was a successful but largely unknown coffee planter. He was outraged by the country's corrupt government. Like those that had preceded it, the government rigged elections; it shot or jailed political opponents; it allowed the army to brutalize the population into abject submission. In 1942, Figueres gave a radio speech attacking the country's president. For this act, he was sent into exile. But his courageous defiance made him a national hero. Six years later, he led an armed **coup** that toppled the government.

The year 1948 marked the beginning of a new **epoch** in Costa Rican history. In May of that year, Figueres formed a new government. Within months, his government had transformed Costa Rica. Among the reforms he **instituted** were full voting rights for women, low-cost health care, and free and open elections. But his most amazing accomplishment was the **renunciation** of war. This was not mere **rhetoric**. Figueres followed up his declaration by abolishing Costa Rica's army. Taking a sledgehammer, he struck the symbolic blow that began the destruction of the army's headquarters. As head of the National Liberation Party, which he formed, Figueres was three times elected president of his country. Each reelection further indicated the strong **rapport** that existed between the citizens and this leader.

Now, in 1987, the aged Costa Rican **patriarch** stood on the steps of the Metropolitan Cathedral with Oscar Arias Sánchez. The younger man, he hoped, would carry their dream of peace beyond the nation's frontiers. The former and current presidents acknowledged the cheers of the people as they made their way on foot, and without need of protection, to the National Museum of Culture. This museum was once the site of the **citadel**, headquarters for the army. Observing the two leaders, an onlooker commented, "It was as though George Washington had appeared at the inauguration of John F. Kennedy."

Oscar Arias Sánchez served as president until 1990 and was reelected to a second term, which he served from 2006 until 2010. Between terms as president, he used his Nobel Prize money to establish the Arias Foundation for Peace and Human Progress.`,

*   If, after having a "heart-to-heart" talk with someone, you find yourselves in complete agreement, you could say that you are in **accord** with each other. This would be particularly appropriate because the word is formed from the Latin prefix *ad-*, meaning "to," and the Latin root *cor*, meaning "heart." Other English words derived from this same Latin root include *courage*, *cordial*, and *cardiac*.

*   In French, *coup* means "blow" or "strike." **Coup** in English, meaning "the overthrow of a government," is short for the French *coup d'état* (pronounced *koo dā tā*), meaning "a sudden blow within the state."
    A coupe (pronounced *koop*) is a closed, two-door automobile. A *coop* (also pronounced *koop*) is a shed where animals such as chickens or rabbits are kept.

*   The adjective form of **rhetoric** is *rhetorical*. A *rhetorical question* is one that is asked only for effect and does not require an answer. *What sort of person would betray his country for a few dollars?* is a rhetorical question.
