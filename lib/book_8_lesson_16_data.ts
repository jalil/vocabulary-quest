    title: "Reading Passage: The Wisdom of Rabbi Rabinowicz",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `The Jewish people long ago discovered that humor can be an **antidote** for life's hardships, and this fact is reflected in many of their folk tales. The following story, from Russia, tells of Moishe, a hardworking but poor tailor, and his wife, Sarah. Did I say poor? Truth to tell, Moishe's business endeavors brought in barely enough money to pay the rent on their small house and put food on their table.

Moishe's brother Jacob and sister-in-law Martha lived in the adjoining village with their six children. Jacob described his occupation as a roofer, but his earnings never amounted to more than a **pittance**, for—as he never tired of explaining—a roofer can't work in the rain, and when it isn't raining, who needs roof repairs?

One day Jacob came to his brother with a plea for assistance. He and his family had been evicted from their home and were in dire need of a place to stay. Of course, it would be only temporary. Moishe sympathized with his brother but explained that his house was barely spacious enough for two. How would eight more people fit into it? But Jacob, though an indifferent roofer, was a **glib** talker. In no time at all, he had **cajoled** his brother into offering temporary accommodations.

And so the Jacob Rabinowicz family moved in. And **bedlam** moved in with them. The noise was **incessant**. The six children fought amongst themselves, chased the cat, and were generally unruly, while their **indulgent** parents looked on with smiles on their faces. They saw nothing wrong with their children's behavior. Martha's **strident** voice could be heard from morning to night, finding fault with Sarah's housekeeping and cooking. And Jacob, when he wasn't eating or sleeping, **lolled** on the sofa. As the days turned into weeks, Moishe became **vehement** in his demands that they leave, but Jacob was immovable. "Have you no heart?" he asked. "Would you throw your own brother out into the cold?"

Sarah did her best to **alleviate** the situation by spending as much time as possible at her sister's house; poor Moishe, who had to work at home, had no such escape. When he could stand it no longer, he went to see the Rabbi. "I'm a desperate man," he told the holy man as he poured out his troubles. "I **rue** the day I let my brother into my house. Look at me! I am a broken man." His **haggard** appearance was proof of what he said. "Unless you help me," he continued, "I don't know what will happen to me." The Rabbi listened **immaculately**? No, that doesn't fit... The Rabbi listened carefully. He sat in silence for a long time, stroking his beard. Finally he spoke. "Do you have any chickens?" he asked. "Yes," replied Moishe, surprised by the question. "We have six." "Excellent," said the Rabbi, "Bring them into the house." "But Rabbi," Moishe protested, "you don't understand. My house is already so crowded it's bursting!" "Do as I say," the Rabbi replied in a tone that allowed no further discussion.

Moishe did as he was told. The next day he returned to the synagogue. He was more **pungent**? No... He was even more distressed than before. "Rabbi," he cried, "the stench is unbearable. The noise is deafening. My house is a barnyard. Please, I beg of you, tell me what to do." The Rabbi looked at him with sympathy. "You have a goat, do you not?" he asked. "Yes," replied Moishe, "an old nanny goat that gives a little milk." "Excellent," said the Rabbi. "Bring the goat into the house." Moishe was speechless, but he knew better than to question the Rabbi's wisdom. He went home and brought the goat into the house.

The next day he returned to the Rabbi. He was trembling and on the verge of tears. "Rabbi," he sobbed, "my life is a misery. The chickens cluck and flap their wings; the goat butts everyone with her horns and eats the furniture. Jacob and Martha scream at each other, and the children scream at the animals. I can't take any more." "Go home," said the Rabbi, "and remove the chickens and the goat."
    
Moishe went home and did as he was told. A great quiet descended on the house. The six children, fascinated by the animals, had followed them out into the yard. Jacob and Martha went out to join them. Moishe and Sarah were alone at last. Peace and contentment **pervaded** the house? No, that word isn't in the list... Peace and contentment filled the house. To Moishe and Sarah, it felt **immaculate**? No... To Moishe and Sarah, their home felt incredibly spacious and quiet. It was a miracle!`,
