    content: `Most sports have separate divisions for men and women. No such **distinction** exists between male and female **participants** in the Iditarod, a **grueling** race of sixty or more dogsleds across 1,157 miles from Anchorage to Nome, Alaska. Probably its most famous competitor was Susan Butcher, who won the event for the third **consecutive** year in 1988, and who—despite the most **adverse** weather conditions in the history of the race—went on to win it for a fourth time in 1990. Butcher considered the Iditarod to be the ultimate test of **endurance** for both animals and humans.

The race, which extends over some of the most **desolate** trails on earth, lasts up to fourteen days. The competitors, called "mushers," get little sleep during this time. A **compulsory** twenty-four-hour stopover at the checkpoint of their choice gives them a brief respite. But even the most **robust** mushers have to fight a constant battle with fatigue during the race's final days.

Unpredictable weather conditions are another hazard. Temperatures can **fluctuate** between fifty degrees below zero and forty degrees above. Snowstorms are not uncommon, with icy winds reaching speeds of 140 miles an hour. In the 1984 race, a section of the overland route was closed. Strong winds had blown away the snow covering. Butcher and her dogs took an **alternative** sea route over the ice-covered Norton Sound. The ice gave way. Susan and her dog team plunged into the frigid water. Led by Granite, her lead dog, they scrambled for shore and went on with the race. Butcher stayed warm by running alongside her sled. That year she came in second.

Wild animals are another of the many dangers mushers face. In the 1985 race, Butcher's dog team was attacked by a starving moose that probably thought her dogs were a pack of wolves. Having to protect her dogs and herself, she fought off the enraged moose with an ax. Finally another musher, who was armed with a gun, pulled up behind her and quickly **dispatched** the moose. Two of her dogs were killed in the attack. Thirteen other dogs were badly **mauled**. That was one year she did not finish.

Born in 1954, Butcher had loved dogs since her youth. In 1975, she moved from her native Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Eureka, Alaska. There she bred and trained dogs at her Trail Breaker Kennels up until her death from leukemia in 2006. As many as 150 dogs were there at any one time. She said that they were all her pets and had the run of her home, although of course not all at once. Butcher was somewhat **aloof** by nature. She was more at ease with her dogs than she was with people. She believed that the secret of her success was the strong bond she formed with her **canine** companions from the time they were born.

As to the future of the Iditarod, Mother Nature and the effects of climate change have the final word. At the 2016 Iditarod, snow had to be brought in by train to provide enough cover for the race to take place.`,

    content: `• **Adverse** should not be confused with *averse*, which means "having an active, strong dislike." If a person has a serious heart condition, strenuous exercise might have an *adverse* effect on that person's health; such a person might, therefore, be *averse* to such exercise.

• Don't confuse **alternative** (the noun or the adjective) with *alternate*, the verb meaning "to happen by turns" or "to take turns." (Boys and girls *alternate* in using the swimming pool.) *Alternate* is also an adjective, meaning "happening by turns" (The wall was painted in *alternate* stripes of red and white) and "every other" (We take turns driving the children on *alternate* days). Finally, *alternate* is a noun meaning "a person chosen to take the place of another." (If you cannot attend the meeting, you must name an *alternate*.)

• **Canine** comes from the Latin word for *dog*, which is *canis*.

Latin names of other animals provide us with a number of words having to do with animals or with qualities associated with them. Among them are the following: *Apis*, "bee," gives us *apiary*, a collection of hives where bees are kept for their honey. *Avis*, "bird," gives us *aviary*, a large, caged enclosure where birds are kept, and *aviation*, which is the science of airplanes and flying. *Asinus*, "donkey," gives us *asinine*, which means "like a donkey" and, hence, "stupid" or "silly" because of the old belief that donkeys are stupid animals.`,
