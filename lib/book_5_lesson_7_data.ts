    title: "Birds in Tuxedos",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `What is a bird? A creature that flies, of course. And yet, penguins are birds, but they cannot fly. Their wings are too **feeble** to lift them off the ground. This was not always so. Scientists believe that penguins once flew just like other birds. At some time in the **remote** past, they migrated to Antarctica. That is the frozen land that surrounds the South Pole. The ice sheet there is two miles thick in places. The temperature varies between zero in summer and negative seventy degrees in winter. It is possible that penguins were the only creatures that could survive in such a **harsh** climate. Without enemies, they would have no need to use their wings, as other birds do, to escape attacks. Gradually, they would have lost the ability to fly.

Over many thousands of years, the wings of penguins became smaller and more **rigid**. To **compensate** for the loss, it seems, they became excellent swimmers. They use their wings as flippers. Their webbed feet help guide them through the water. They can dive to depths of seventy feet and often leap high out of the water for a breath of air. On land, they **waddle** awkwardly or slide along the ice on their stomachs. But under water they glide gracefully and effortlessly. Penguins spend a lot of time in the sea in a never-ending search for fish, lobster, crabs, and shrimp. These foods make up a **substantial** part of their diet.

There are several different kinds of penguins. The smallest is no bigger than a duck. The largest, called the Emperor penguin, is four feet tall and weighs up to ninety pounds. In addition to the shores of Antarctica, penguins make their homes farther north. They live on the coasts of South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, or on the Pacific coast of South America.

Each year for several months, penguins come to land to make nests and lay their eggs. Along the shores of Antarctica, where no plants grow, the penguins gather stones for their nests. Females **deposit** the eggs, chalky white in color and usually no more than two, on the nest. Emperor penguins do not build nests. Instead, after an egg is laid, the male penguin holds it on his feet under a fold of stomach skin. This keeps the egg warm. The female Emperor penguin returns to the **frigid** waters to hunt for food for her family.

For two months, the baby penguins develop in the eggs. All that time the male Emperor penguins **huddle** close together in **colonies** of up to half a million birds so that they can keep warm. A **solitary** penguin would soon lose its body heat and die in the freezing cold of the long Antarctic night. When the baby penguins break out of the shells, they are unable to see and are quite helpless. For several months they have to be fed by their parents before they are ready to take to the water to find their own food.

On land penguins are unlikely to be mistaken for any other kind of bird. With black feathers covering their backs and snowy white feathers running up their fronts, they **resemble** very short men wearing **formal** dress. Their appearance, combined with the way they walk, makes them look slightly comical. Perhaps this explains in part why we humans find them such **fascinating** creatures.`,

# Fun & Fascinating FACTS

* The adjective formed from **colony** is *colonial*. (Virginia was one of the thirteen American *colonies* that declared their independence from British rule in 1776. The town of Williamsburg, Virginia, re-creates life in *colonial* America.)

* Note that **colony** can also refer to a group of people, especially artists and writers, who come together in a particular place. There they can meet and exchange ideas while working without distractions.

* **Remote** and *distant* are synonyms. Both words mean "far off in distance or time." *Remote*, however, also suggests something cut off and out of the way. Tristan da Cunha, an island in the South Atlantic, and Tokyo, Japan, are each *distant* from New York. But Tokyo is not considered a *remote* city, because it is easy to get to by plane. Tristan da Cunha, however, is thought of as a *remote* island because it is difficult to get to.

* **Solitary** is formed from the Latin *solus*, which means "alone." Several other words are formed from the same Latin root. *Solitude* is "the quality or state of being alone." (Henry David Thoreau was seeking *solitude* when he lived alone in the woods near Walden Pond.) *Isolated* means "cut off from the company of others." (We felt *isolated* when the blizzard kept us inside for three days.) *Solitaire* is a card game for just one person.`,
