    title: "Reading Passage: A Noble Bargain",
    type: "non-fiction",
    content: `Throughout history, countries that have extended their borders have done so mainly by military conquest; the United States is one of the few nations that has ever done so by purchase. In one of the greatest bargains ever made, it **procured** almost a million square miles at a cost of just over fifteen million dollars.

In 1802, the **sovereignty** of the United States ended at the Mississippi River. France had a legal claim to all the land beyond it as far as the Rocky Mountains. United States shipping on the Mississippi passed through New Orleans, Louisiana, on its way to the sea. President Thomas Jefferson was **perturbed** by the possibility that France might close off the river. To prevent this, he **resolved** to buy New Orleans, together with western Florida, from the French.

Certain conditions were in Jefferson's favor. France was on the verge of war with Britain and, therefore, needed money. Should the British attack New Orleans, the French would, Jefferson believed, have difficulty defending it. It made sense to conclude that France would prefer the territory go to America rather than to Britain.

To pursue his plan, Jefferson **appointed** two agents to represent the United States. These agents met with the French foreign minister in France to discuss the purchase. He proposed that the United States buy all the land from the Mississippi to the Rockies, a total of almost a million square miles. The two Americans were **flabbergasted** but **receptive** to the idea. Congress had approved spending only two million dollars; however, the cost would now greatly exceed that amount. After a considerable amount of **haggling**, a price of fifteen million dollars was finally agreed on. The French foreign minister commented at the time the deal was struck that the United States had made "a noble bargain."

Members of Congress did not **concur** with this view and wanted to **repudiate** the agreement with France. They thought that fifteen million dollars was an excessive amount to pay. They were also upset that the president's agents had agreed to the French offer without **consulting** them. President Jefferson appeared before Congress in an attempt to **dissuade** its members from voting against the purchase. He pointed out that the United States would be doubled in size by the transaction. He also stated that if the United States did not act promptly, the French might withdraw their offer. Somewhat grudgingly, Congress gave its **assent** to the "Louisiana Purchase." A year later the United States flag was raised in New Orleans, **signifying** the end of France's involvement in North America.

Just how good a bargain was the Louisiana Purchase? Iowa farmland in 2003 sold for about $2,500 an acre. The six hundred million acres of land the United States bought in 1803 had cost the **trifling** sum of two and a half cents an acre.`,

• **Procure** is one of several English words formed from the Latin *cura*, meaning "care." A **procurator** (from the Latin *pro*, "on behalf of," and *curare*, "to care for") was a Roman official who had charge of the finances of a province. The most famous procurator was Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea at the time Jesus was crucified.`,
